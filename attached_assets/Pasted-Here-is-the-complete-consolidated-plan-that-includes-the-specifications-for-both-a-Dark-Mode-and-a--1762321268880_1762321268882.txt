Here is the complete, consolidated plan that includes the specifications for both a Dark Mode and a Light Mode theme. This single document provides all the instructions for your Replit agent.

VapeCaveTx.com: Complete UI/UX & Technical Plan (Dual Theme)
This document outlines the design, layout, functionality, and admin requirements for the website, including a dual-theme system (Light & Dark).

🎨 Part 1: Color Palettes & Theme System
The site should be built to support both themes. A "theme toggle" (e.g., a ☀️/🌙 icon) should be placed in the Global Header to allow users to switch. The admin portal should define the default theme for new visitors.

Primary Background: "Charcoal" (#1A1A1A)

Secondary Background (Cards/Modals): "Dark Grey" (#242424)

Typography (Headings): "Pure White" (#FFFFFF)

Light Mode
Primary Background: "Off-White" (#FAFAFA)

Secondary Background (Cards/Modals): "Pure White" (#FFFFFF)

Typography (Headings): "Charcoal" (#1A1A1A)

Typography (Body): "Medium Grey" (#555555)

Accent Colors (Shared by Both Themes)
Primary Accent (CTA): "Vibrant Orange" (#FF7100)

Usage: Add to Cart, Checkout, Place Order, Sign Up, selected toggles.

🏛️ Part 2: Global UI Components (The "Frame")
1. Global Header

Theme: Uses the Secondary Background color (#242424 dark, #FFFFFF light) with a subtle box-shadow in Light Mode.

Desktop Location (Left to Right):

Left: vapecavetx.com Logo.

"My Account" and "Pickup/Delivery" move inside the Hamburger Menu.

2. Global Footer
Design: A simple, non-sticky footer.

Theme: Uses the Primary Background color (#1A1A1A dark, #FAFAFA light).

Desktop Location: A single row at the bottom with 3-4 links (e.g., "© 2025 Vape Cave," "Terms of Service") using Typography (Body) color.

Mobile Behavior: The links stack vertically, centered.

🛍️ Part 3: UI/UX Structure & Component Location
1. The Homepage (The "Digital Storefront")
Component: Hero Carousel (Slideshow)

Desktop Location: Full-width (edge-to-edge), directly below the Global Header.

Mobile Behavior: Same. Full-width, swipeable.

Component: Featured Products Row

Desktop Location: Below the Hero. A heading (using Typography (Headings) color): "Featured Picks." Below this, a horizontal, scrollable row of 4-5 product cards.

Theme: Each card uses the Secondary Background color.

Mobile Behavior: Becomes a swipeable horizontal carousel (showing 1.5-2 cards).

Component: Category Links

Desktop Location: Below "Featured." An h2 heading: "Shop by Category." Below this, a 3-column grid of large, clickable blocks.

Theme: Each block uses the Secondary Background color.

Mobile Behavior: Becomes a 2-column grid.

Component: Promotion/Deal Section

Desktop Location: Below "Categories." A 2-column grid of promotional banners.

Mobile Behavior: The 2 columns stack vertically.

2. The Product Listing Page (PLP) (e.g., "All Products")
Component: Advanced Filtering

Desktop Location: A permanent left-hand sidebar (approx. 25% width).

Theme: Sidebar uses the Secondary Background color.

Mobile Behavior: The sidebar is hidden. A "Filters" button (using Primary Accent (CTA) color) appears at the top. When tapped, a full-screen modal/bottom-sheet appears.

Component: Product Grid

Desktop Location: The main content area (approx. 75% width). At the top-right is a "Sort By" dropdown. Below is a 3 or 4-column grid of Product Cards.

Theme: The main area uses Primary Background. The Product Cards use Secondary Background.

Mobile Behavior: "Sort By" is at the top. Grid becomes a 2-column grid.

3. The Product Detail "Quick View" (As a Pop-Up Modal)
Desktop Location: A modal window that overlays the page. The page behind is dimmed.

Theme: The modal uses the Secondary Background color.

Desktop Layout (Inside Modal):

Two-column layout: Left (40%) for Image Gallery, Right (60%) for Info.

Right Column Info: Product Name (uses Typography (Headings)), Price, Description (uses Typography (Body)), Dropdown selectors, Quantity Selector, and a large, full-width Primary Accent (CTA) "Add to Cart" button.

"Close (X)" icon in the top-right.

Mobile Behavior:

The modal becomes full-screen.

It stacks vertically: (1) Header with "Close (X)", (2) Image Gallery, (3) Product Info.

Bottom (Sticky): The Quantity Selector and the Primary Accent (CTA) "Add to Cart" button must be stuck to the bottom of the screen for easy thumb access.

4. The Customer Account Dashboard
Desktop Location: A standard two-column layout.

Left Column: A navigation menu (My Profile, Order History, etc.) on a Secondary Background card.

Right Column: The content for the selected menu item on the Primary Background.

Mobile Behavior:

The left navigation menu is replaced by a dropdown menu at the top of the page.

✨ Part 4: Animations & Effects
Hover Effects:

Buttons: All Primary Accent (CTA) buttons should slightly brighten or "lift" (transform: translateY(-2px);) on hover.

Product Cards: On hover, the card should scale up subtly (transform: scale(1.03);) or (in Light Mode) its box-shadow should grow.

Add to Cart Animation:

User clicks "Add to Cart."

The button text immediately becomes a "Loading Spinner."

After 1 second, the spinner becomes a "Checkmark ✔" (using Secondary Accent (Info) green).

The "Shopping Cart" icon in the Global Header "jiggles" or "pulses" once.

Page Load:

Lazy Loading: As the user scrolls down the product grid, new product cards should fade in gently from the bottom (opacity: 0; to opacity: 1;).
